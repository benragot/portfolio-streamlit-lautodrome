Big shout-out to @eyesupautoart. He hit me up several months ago to paint the same car as a collab. We chose the GT40 and one picture. And without further consultation, we ended up with those two pieces. Nice to see the different styles expressed through the paint while we have sort of a similar approach at first. As for differences, he uses canvas and brushes, I mainly use paper, spray paint and acrylic markers. Give him a follow @eyesupautoart ! #ford #fordracing #fordgt40 #fordgt #gt40 #racecar #racingcar #classicracing #goodwood #supercar #cardrawing #carart #carartistcommunity #drawtodrive #automotiveart #acrylicpainting #carpainting #lemans #carillustration #molotowpaint #classiccar #sportscar #legendcar
